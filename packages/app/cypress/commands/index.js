* cypress/support/auth.js

* Implementation note:
*   We use "real" 'signInWithCustomToken' that signs up the users in Firebase Auth Emulation. 'npm run dev' has the
*   '?user=xyz' parameter that would do the same but we don't need to go through it.
*
* Note:
*   We cannot 'import' any of the application sources, since they use '/@xxx' path mapping. (This should be fine.)

* 'cy.visit'.
*
* Note:
*   This is needed because Cypress does _not_ clear IndexedDB between tests. The whole discussion about how state
*   clearing / carry-over is to be handled is still ongoing (Oct 2020; Cypress 5.3.0). The stated _idea_ is that
*   default would "clear all" (it doesn't, currently), but test authors be given control about which parts they
*   want cleared, which not. Makes sense.
